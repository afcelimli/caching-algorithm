# Popularity Based Caching
Mobile traffic in network is increasing. Video contents generate most of this traffic. When the increase in network traffic is taken into consideration, it seems unlikely that our current host based network will supply with peopleâ€™s expectations. Academicians thinks that a content based network can solve possible future problems. Our motivation in this study to propose a popularity based caching algorithm for content based network that will reduce latency, while increasing local hit ratio compared to least recently used(LRU) caching and least frequently used(LFU) caching. 

Results for latency:
